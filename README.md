# Optional Flexbox Demo

Hello fellow Flexbox-ians.  If you're as overwhlemed as I was with the material presented on Day 4-5, here's something what worked for me.  As well-documented as the lessons are I found myself not learning Flexbox very well.  Instead I learned a great deal by following along with the [optional Codecademy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoozHSLo54U) and coding alongside the instructor.  I filled half my screen with a text editor and the other half with the browser window and the video (opened in VLC, but you can cram it into another browser window too).

Here's the [screen layout](https://imgur.com/j87DLey) I used.

I took the liberty of recreating the instructor's code so you can follow along and make the same edits she does.  It helped me a lot to bang out the code and hit F5 on the browser to see the results.

Feel free to grab the [index.html](https://github.com/hc7w2021/flexboxdemo/blob/master/index.html) and [style.css](https://github.com/hc7w2021/flexboxdemo/blob/master/style.css) files above.

After doing this only once I was able to complete Flexbox Froggy on one attempt.  But I went through the video this way two more times and I'm finally *motivated* to use Flexbox rather than *dreading* the upcoming projects.

I hope this helps!
